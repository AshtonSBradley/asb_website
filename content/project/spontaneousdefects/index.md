A rapid change of environment can force a system to cross the critical point of a phase transition at a finite rate. The transition causes defects to be spontaneously generated - remnants of the broken symmetry frozen into the new phase. The rate of crossing the transition determines density of defects formed: a faster quench creates smaller domains of spontaneously broken symmetry, resulting in a higher density of defects. This process is known as the Kibble-Zurek mechanism after Tom Kibble who came up with the idea, and Wojciech Zurek who made it into a quantitative tool able to explain experimental data.

A quantitative reservoir theory should allow for first-principles description of high-temperature BEC experiments, including spontaneous defect formation during the phase transition. We have developed and applied the Stochastic Projected GPE to modeling quenched Bose gases.
