Quantum entanglement is one of the central mysteries of Physics. Entangled photons provide a valuable resource for quantum information applications. Standard parametric down conversion creates entangled photon pairs with Gaussian quantum statistics. Non-Gaussian tripartite entangled states are of fundamental interest in quantum cryptography due to their robustness in securing against decryption weaknesses. Intracavity triplet down conversion offers a potential route to create useable tripartite entanglement.
