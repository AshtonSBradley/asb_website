When many Bose atoms occupy the same quantum state they exhibit many astonishing physical properties. While quantum fluids share some common features of classical fluids, their fundamentally quantum nature manifests in a variety of interesting phenomena. An aspect of primary interest is the nature of fluid turbulence translated to the quantum realm. 

Key questions are the degree of overlap between classical and quantum fluid phenomena, whether fully developed quantum turbulence can be created and characterized in Bose-Einstein condensates, and the quantum nature of energy transport, spectral condensation, velocity correlations, and other measures of turbulent flows.

Selected publications on quantum turbulence are below.
