abstract: We develop a coarse-grained description of the point-vortex model, finding
  that a large number of planar vortices and antivortices behave as an inviscid non-Eulerian
  fluid at large scales. The emergent binary vortex fluid is subject to anomalous
  stresses absent from Euler's equation, caused by the singular nature of quantum
  vortices. The binary vortex fluid is compressible, and has an asymmetric Cauchy
  stress tensor allowing orbital angular momentum exchange with the vorticity and
  vortex density. An analytic solution for vortex shear flow driven by anomalous stresses
  is in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of the point-vortex model.
