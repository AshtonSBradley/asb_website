 abstract = {A stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation is derived for partially condensed Bose gas systems subject to binary contact interactions. The theory we present provides a classical-field theory suitable for describing dissipative dynamics and phase transitions of spinor and multicomponent Bose gas systems composed of an arbitrary number of distinct interacting Bose fields. A class of dissipative processes involving distinguishable particle interchange between coherent and incoherent regions of phase space is identified. The formalism and its implications are illustrated for two-component mixtures and spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates. For systems composed of atoms of equal mass, with thermal reservoirs that are close to equilibrium, the dissipation rates of the theory are reduced to analytical expressions that may be readily evaluated. The unified treatment of binary contact interactions presented here provides a theory with broad relevance for quasiequilibrium and far-from-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates.},
