abstract: A stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation is derived for partially condensed
  Bose gas systems subject to binary contact interactions. The theory we present provides
  a classical-field theory suitable for describing dissipative dynamics and phase
  transitions of spinor and multicomponent Bose gas systems composed of an arbitrary
  number of distinct interacting Bose fields. A class of dissipative processes involving
  distinguishable particle interchange between coherent and incoherent regions of
  phase space is identified. The formalism and its implications are illustrated for
  two-component mixtures and spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates. For systems composed
  of atoms of equal mass, with thermal reservoirs that are close to equilibrium, the
  dissipation rates of the theory are reduced to analytical expressions that may be
  readily evaluated. The unified treatment of binary contact interactions presented
  here provides a theory with broad relevance for quasiequilibrium and far-from-equilibrium
  Bose-Einstein condensates.
