abstract: We show that an optical parametric oscillator based on three concurrent
  􏰏􏰀2􏰁 nonlinearities can produce, above threshold, bright output beams of macroscopic
  intensities which exhibit strong tripartite continuous- variable entanglement. We
  also show that there are two ways that the system can exhibit a three-mode form
  of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, and calculate the extracavity fluctuation
  spectra that may be measured to verify our predictions.
