abstract: We study the Kelvin mode excitations on a vortex line in a three-dimensional
  trapped Bose-Einstein condensate at finite temperature. Our stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii
  simulations show that the activation of these modes can be suppressed by tightening
  the confinement along the direction of the vortex line, leading to a strong suppression
  in the vortex decay rate as the system enters a regime of two-dimensional vortex
  dynamics. As the system approaches the condensation transition temperature, we find
  that the vortex decay rate is strongly sensitive to dimensionality and temperature,
  observing a large enhancement for quasi-two-dimensional traps. Three-dimensional
  simulations of the recent vortex dipole decay experiment of Neely et al. [Phys.
  Rev. Lett. 104, 160401 (2010)] confirm two-dimensional vortex dynamics and predict
  a dipole lifetime consistent with experimental observations and suppression of Kelvon-induced
  vortex decay in highly oblate condensates.
