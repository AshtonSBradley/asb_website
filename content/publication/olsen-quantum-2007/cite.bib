 abstract = {We describe a scheme, operating in a manner analogous to a reversed Raman output coupler, for measuring the phase-sensitive quadrature statistics of an atom laser beam. This scheme allows for the transferral of the atomic field statistics to an optical field, for which the quantum statistics may then be measured using the well-developed technology of optical homodyne measurement.},
