abstract: We describe a scheme, operating in a manner analogous to a reversed Raman
  output coupler, for measuring the phase-sensitive quadrature statistics of an atom
  laser beam. This scheme allows for the transferral of the atomic field statistics
  to an optical field, for which the quantum statistics may then be measured using
  the well-developed technology of optical homodyne measurement.
