abstract: We study quantum vortex states consisting of a ring of vortices with alternating
  sign, in a homogeneous superfluid confined to a circular domain. We find an exact
  stationary solution of the point vortex model for the neutral vortex necklace. We
  investigate the stability of the necklace state within both the point-vortex model
  and the Gross–Pitaevskii equation describing a trapped atomic Bose–Einstein condensate
  at low temperature. The point-vortex stationary states are found to also be stationary
  states of the Gross–Pitaevskii equation provided the finite thickness of the outer
  fluid boundary is accounted for. Under significant perturbation, the Gross–Pitaevskii
  evolution and point-vortex model exhibit instability as expected for metastable
  states. The perturbed vortex necklace exhibits sensitivity to the perturbation,
  suggesting a route to seeding vortex chaos or quantum turbulence.
