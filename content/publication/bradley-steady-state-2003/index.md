abstract: We present a steady-state analysis of a quantum-mechanical model of an atom
  laser. A single-mode atomic trap coupled to a continuum of external modes is driven
  by a saturable pumping mechanism. In the dilute flux regime, where atom-atom interactions
  are negligible in the output, we find an analytic form for the linewidth and frequency
  shift of the laser. This result does not make the Born-Markov approximation, but
  is based on the far less restrictive ‘‘self-consistent Markov approximation.’’ The
  more exact treatment has a different effective damping rate and occupation of the
  lasing mode, as well as a shifted frequency and linewidth of the output. We examine
  gravitational damping numerically, finding linewidths and frequency shifts for a
  range of pumping rates. We treat mean-field damping analytically, finding a memory
  function for the Thomas-Fermi regime. The occupation and linewidth are found to
  have a nonlinear scaling behavior which has implications for the stability of atom
  lasers.
