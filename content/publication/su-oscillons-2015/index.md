abstract: Long-lived, spatially localized, and temporally oscillating nonlinear excitations
  are predicted by numerical simulation of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. These
  oscillons closely resemble the time-periodic breather solutions of the sine-Gordon
  equation but decay slowly by radiating Bogoliubov phonons. Their time-dependent
  profile is closely matched with solutions of the sine-Gordon equation, which emerges
  as an effective field theory for the relative phase of two linearly coupled Bose
  fields in the weak-coupling limit. For strong coupling the long-lived oscillons
  persist and involve both relative and total phase fields. The oscillons decay via
  Bogoliubov phonon radiation that is increasingly suppressed for decreasing oscillon
  amplitude. Possibilities for creating oscillons are addressed in atomic gas experiments
  by collision of oppositely charged Bose-Josephson vortices and direct phase imprinting.
