 abstract = {We present Ehrenfest relations for the high temperature stochastic Gross–Pitaevskii equation description of a trapped Bose gas, including the effect of growth noise and the energy cutoff. A condition for neglecting the cutoff terms in the Ehrenfest relations is found which is more stringent than the usual validity condition of the truncated Wigner or classical field method—that all modes are highly occupied. The condition requires a small overlap of the nonlinear interaction term with the lowest energy single particle state of the noncondensate band, and gives a means to constrain dynamical artefacts arising from the energy cutoff in numerical simulations. We apply the formalism to two simple test problems: (i) simulation of the Kohn mode oscillation for a trapped Bose gas at zero temperature, and (ii) computing the equilibrium properties of a finite temperature Bose gas within the classical field method. The examples indicate ways to control the effects of the cutoff, and that there is an optimal choice of plane wave basis for a given cutoff energy. This basis gives the best reproduction of the single particle spectrum, the condensate fraction and the position and momentum densities.},
