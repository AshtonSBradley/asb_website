abstract: We perform the first numerical three-dimensional studies of quantum field
  effects in the Bosenova experi- ment on collapsing condensates by E. Donley et al.
  􏰖Nature 􏰔London􏰕 415, 39 􏰔2002􏰕􏰗 using the exact experimental geometry. In a stochastic
  truncated Wigner simulation of the collapse, the collapse times are larger than
  the experimentally measured values. We find that a finite temperature initial state
  leads to an increased creation rate of uncondensed atoms, but not to a reduction
  of the collapse time. A comparison of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
  and Wigner methods for the more tractable spherical trap shows excellent agreement
  between the uncondensed populations. We conclude that the discrepancy between the
  experimental and theoretical values of the collapse time cannot be explained by
  Gaussian quantum fluctuations or finite temperature effects.
