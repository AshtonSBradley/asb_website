abstract: We examine the tripartite entanglement properties of an optical system using
  interlinked $ ensuremath chi(̂2)$ interactions, recently studied experimentally
  in terms of its phase-matching properties by Bondani et al. [Opt. Express 14, 21,
  9838 (2006)]. We show that the system produces output modes at three distinct frequencies
  which are genuinely tripartite entangled, and analyze this entanglement in terms
  of different measurable correlations. We show that, due to the asymmetry of the
  process, the detection of this entanglement depends crucially on the correlation
  functions that are measured. We find that some of the correlations found in the
  literature fail to register the entanglement, in contrast to symmetric systems,
  for which the actual choice of correlation to be measured makes little difference.
