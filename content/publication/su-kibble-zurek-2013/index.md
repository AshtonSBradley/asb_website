abstract: Atomic Bose-Einstein condensates confined to a dual-ring trap support Josephson
  vortices as topologically stable defects in the relative phase. We propose a test
  of the scaling laws for defect formation by quenching a Bose gas to degeneracy in
  this geometry. Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii simulations reveal a âˆ’1/4 power-law scaling
  of defect number with quench time for fast quenches, consistent with the Kibble-Zurek
  mechanism. Slow quenches show stronger quench-time dependence that is explained
  by the stability properties of Josephson vortices, revealing the boundary of the
  Kibble-Zurek regime. Interference of the two atomic fields enables clear long-time
  measurement of stable defects and a direct test of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in
  Bose-Einstein condensation.
