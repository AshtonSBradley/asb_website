abstract: An easily scalable toroidal geometry presents an opportunity for creating
  large-scale persistent currents in Bose-Einstein condensates, for studies of the
  Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and for investigations of toroidally trapped degenerate
  Fermi gases. We consider in detail the process of isentropic loading of a Bose or
  Fermi gas from a harmonic trap into the scale-invariant toroidal regime that exhibits
  a high degree of system invariance when increasing the radius of the toroid. The
  heating involved in loading a Bose gas is evaluated analytically and numerically,
  both above and below the critical temperature. Our numerical calculations treat
  interactions within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov-Popov theory. Minimal change in
  degeneracy is observed over a wide range of initial temperatures, and a regime of
  cooling is identified. The scale-invariant property is further investigated analytically
  by studying the density of states of the system, revealing the robust nature of
  scale invariance in this trap, for both bosons and fermions. We give analytical
  results for a Thomas-Fermi treatment. We calculate the heating due to loading a
  spin-polarized Fermi gas and compare with analytical results for high- and low-temperature
  regimes. The Fermi gas is subjected to irreducible heating during loading, caused
  by the loss of one degree of freedom for thermalization.
