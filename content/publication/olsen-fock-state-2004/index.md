abstract: By stochastic modeling of the process of Raman photoassociation of Bose-Einstein
  condensates, we show that, the farther the initial quantum state is from a coherent
  state, the farther the one-dimensional predictions are from those of the commonly
  used zero-dimensional approach. We compare the dynamics of condensates, initially
  in different quantum states, finding that, even when the quantum prediction for
  an initial coherent state is relatively close to the Gross-Pitaevskii prediction,
  an initial Fock state gives qualitatively different predictions. We also show that
  this difference is not present in a single-mode type of model, but that the quantum
  statistics assume a more important role as the dimensionality of the model is increased.
  This contrasting behavior in different dimensions, well known with critical phenomena
  in statistical mechanics, makes itself plainly visible here in a mesoscopic system
  and is a strong demonstration of the need to consider physically realistic models
  of interacting condensates.
