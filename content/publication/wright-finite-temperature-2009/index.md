abstract: We consider a finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate in a quasi-two-dimensional
  trap containing a single precessing vortex. We find that such a configuration arises
  naturally as an ergodic equilibrium of the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation,
  when constrained to a finite conserved angular momentum. In an isotropic trapping
  potential, the condensation of the classical field into an off-axis vortex state
  breaks the rotational symmetry of the system. We present a methodology to identify
  the condensate and the Goldstone mode associated with the broken rotational symmetry
  in the classical-field model. We also examine the variation in vortex trajectories
  and thermodynamic parameters of the field as the energy of the microcanonical field
  simulation is varied.
