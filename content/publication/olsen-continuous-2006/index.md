abstract: We compare theoretically the tripartite entanglement available from the
  use of three concurrent χ(2) nonlinearities and three independent squeezed states
  mixed on beamsplitters, using an appropriate version of the van Loock–Furusawa inequalities.
  We also define three-mode generalizations of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox
  which are an alternative for demonstrating the inseparability of the density matrix.
