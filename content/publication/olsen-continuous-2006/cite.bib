 abstract = {We compare theoretically the tripartite entanglement available from the use of three concurrent χ(2) nonlinearities and three independent squeezed states mixed on beamsplitters, using an appropriate version of the van Loock–Furusawa inequalities. We also define three-mode generalizations of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox which are an alternative for demonstrating the inseparability of the density matrix.},
