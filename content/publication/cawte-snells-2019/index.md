abstract: A quantum vortex dipole, comprised of a closely bound pair of vortices of
  equal strength with opposite circulation, is a spatially localized travelling excitation
  of a planar super- fluid that carries linear momentum, suggesting a possible analogy
  with ray optics. We investigate numerically and analytically the motion of a quantum
  vortex dipole incident upon a step-change in the background superfluid density of
  an otherwise uniform two- dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. Due to the conservation
  of fluid momentum and energy, the incident and refracted angles of the dipole satisfy
  a relation analogous to Snell’s law, when crossing the interface between regions
  of different density. The pre- dictions of the analogue Snell’s law relation are
  confirmed for a wide range of incident angles by systematic numerical simulations
  of the Gross-Piteavskii equation. Near the critical angle for total internal reflection,
  we identify a regime of anomalous Snell’s law behaviour where the finite size of
  the dipole causes transient capture by the interface. Remarkably, despite the extra
  complexity of the interface interaction, the incoming and outgoing dipole paths
  obey Snell’s law.
