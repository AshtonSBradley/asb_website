abstract: We explore the possible regimes of decaying two-dimensional quantum turbulence,
  and elucidate the nature of spectral energy transport by introducing a dissipative
  point-vortex model with phenomenological vortex-sound interactions. The model is
  valid for a large system with weak dissipation, and also for systems with strong
  dissipation, and allows us to extract a meaningful and unambiguous spectral energy
  flux associated with quantum vortex motion. For weak dissipation and large system
  size we find a regime of hydrodynamic vortex turbulence in which energy is transported
  to large spatial scales, resembling the phenomenology of the transient inverse cascade
  observed in decaying turbulence in classical incompressible fluids. For strong dissipation
  the vortex dynamics are dominated by dipole recombination and exhibit no appreciable
  spectral transport of energy.
