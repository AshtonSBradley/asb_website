abstract: We develop a stochastic Gross-Pitaveskii theory suitable for the study of
  Bose-Einstein condensation in a rotating dilute Bose gas. The theory is used to
  model the dynamical and equilibrium properties of a rapidly rotating Bose gas quenched
  through the critical point for condensation, as in the experiment of Haljan et al.
  [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 210403 (2001)]. In contrast to stirring a vortex-free condensate,
  where topological constraints require that vortices enter from the edge of the condensate,
  we find that phase defects in the initial noncondensed cloud are trapped en masse
  in the emerging condensate. Bose-stimulated condensate growth proceeds into a disordered
  vortex configuration. At sufficiently low temperature the vortices then order into
  a regular Abrikosov lattice in thermal equilibrium with the rotating cloud. We calculate
  the effect of thermal fluctuations on vortex ordering in the final gas at different
  temperatures, and find that the BEC transition is accompanied by lattice melting
  associated with diminishing long-range correlations between vortices across the
  system.
