abstract: Despite the prominence of Onsagerâ€™s point-vortex model as a statistical
  description of 2D classical turbulence, a first-principles development of the model
  for a realistic superfluid has remained an open problem. Here we develop a mapping
  of a system of quantum vortices described by the homogeneous 2D Gross-Pitaevskii
  equation (GPE) to the point-vortex model, enabling Monte Carlo sampling of the vortex
  microcanonical ensemble. We use this approach to survey the full range of vortex
  states in a 2D superfluid, from the vortex-dipole gas at positive temperature to
  negative-temperature states exhibiting both macroscopic vortex clustering and kinetic
  energy condensation, which we term an Onsager-Kraichnan condensate (OKC). Damped
  GPE simulations reveal that such OKC states can emerge dynamically, via aggregation
  of small-scale clusters into giant OKC clusters, as the end states of decaying 2D
  quantum turbulence in a compressible, finite-temperature superfluid. These statistical
  equilibrium states should be accessible in atomic Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.
