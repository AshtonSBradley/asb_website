abstract: We consider a system of bosonic atoms in an axially symmetric harmonic trap
  augmented with a two- dimensional repulsive Gaussian optical potential. We find
  an expression for the grand free energy of the system for configurations ranging
  from the harmonic trap to the toroidal regime. For large tori we identify an acces-
  sible regime where the ideal-gas thermodynamics of the system are found to be independent
  of toroidal radius. This property is a consequence of an invariant extensive volume
  of the system that we identify analytically in the regime where the toroidal potential
  is radially harmonic. In considering corrections to the scale-invariant transition
  temperature, we find that the first-order interaction shift is the dominant effect
  in the thermodynamic limit and is also scale invariant. We also consider adiabatic
  loading from the harmonic-to-toroidal trap con- figuration, which we show to have
  only a small effect on the condensate fraction of the ideal gas, indicating that
  loading into the scale-invariant regime may be experimentally practical.
