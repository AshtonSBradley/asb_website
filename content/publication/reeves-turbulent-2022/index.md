abstract: We experimentally study the emergence of microcanonical equilibrium states
  in the turbulent relaxation dynamics of a two-dimensional chiral vortex gas. Same-sign
  vortices are injected into a quasi-two-dimensional disk-shaped atomic Bose-Einstein
  condensate using a range of mechanical stirring protocols. The resulting long-time
  vortex distributions are found to be in excellent agreement with the mean-field
  Poisson Boltzmann equation for the system describing the microcanonical ensemble
  at fixed energy H and angular momentum M. The equilibrium states are characterized
  by the corresponding thermodynamic variables of inverse temperature β̂ and rotation
  frequency .̂ We are able to realize equilibria spanning the full phase diagram of
  the vortex gas, including on-axis states near zero temperature, infinite temperature,
  and negative absolute temperatures. At sufficiently high energies, the system exhibits
  a symmetry-breaking transition, resulting in an off-axis equilibrium phase at negative
  absolute temperature that no longer shares the symmetry of the container. We introduce
  a point-vortex model with phenomenological damping and noise that is able to quantitatively
  reproduce the equilibration dynamics.
