abstract: We investigate an experimentally feasible intracavity coupled down-conversion
  scheme to generate quadripartite entanglement using concurrent nonlinearities. We
  verify that quadripartite entanglement is present in this system by calculating
  the output fluctuation spectra and then considering violations of optimized inequalities
  of the van Loock-Furusawa type. The entanglement characteristics both above and
  below the oscillation threshold are considered. We also present analytic solutions
  for the quadrature operators and the van Loock-Furusawa correlations in the undepleted
  pump approximation.
