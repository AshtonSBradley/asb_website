abstract: We describe a method for evolving the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation
  􏰔PGPE􏰕 for an interacting Bose gas in a harmonic-oscillator potential, with the
  inclusion of a long-range dipolar interaction. The central difficulty in solving
  this equation is the requirement that the field is restricted to a small set of
  prescribed modes that constitute the low-energy c-field region of the system. We
  present a scheme, using a Hermite- polynomial-based spectral representation, which
  precisely implements this mode restriction and allows an efficient and accurate
  solution of the dipolar PGPE. We introduce a set of auxiliary oscillator states
  to perform a Fourier transform necessary to evaluate the dipolar interaction in
  reciprocal space. We extensively charac- terize the accuracy of our approach and
  derive Ehrenfest equations for the evolution of the angular momentum.
