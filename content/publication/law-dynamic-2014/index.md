abstract: We study conditions under which vortices in a highly oblate harmonically
  trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can be stabilized due to pinning by a blue-detuned
  Gaussian laser beam, with particular emphasis on the potentially destabilizing effects
  of laser beam positioning within the BEC. Our approach involves theoretical and
  numerical exploration of dynamically and energetically stable pinning of vortices
  with winding number up to $S=6$, in correspondence with experimental observations.
  Stable pinning is quantified theoretically via Bogoliubov-de Gennes excitation spectrum
  computations and confirmed via direct numerical simulations for a range of conditions
  similar to those of experimental observations. The theoretical and numerical results
  indicate that the pinned winding number, or equivalently the winding number of the
  superfluid current about the laser beam, decays as a laser beam of fixed intensity
  moves away from the BEC center. Our theoretical analysis helps explain previous
  experimental observations and helps define limits of stable vortex pinning for future
  experiments involving vortex manipulation by laser beams.
