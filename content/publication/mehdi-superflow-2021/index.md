abstract: We theoretically investigate the stochastic decay of persistent currents
  in a toroidal ultra- cold atomic superfluid caused by a perturbing barrier. Specifically,
  we perform detailed three-dimensional simulations to model the experiment of Kumar
  et al. in [Phys. Rev. A 95 021602 (2017)], which observed a strong temperature dependence
  in the timescale of superflow decay in an ultracold Bose gas. Our ab initio numerical
  approach exploits a classical-field framework that includes thermal fluctuations
  due to interactions between the superfluid and a thermal cloud, as well as the intrinsic
  quantum fluctuations of the Bose gas. In the low-temperature regime our simulations
  provide a quantitative descrip- tion of the experimental decay timescales, improving
  on previous numerical and ana- lytical approaches. At higher temperatures, our simulations
  give decay timescales that range over the same orders of magnitude observed in the
  experiment, however, there are some quantitative discrepancies that are not captured
  by any of the mechanisms we explore. Our results suggest a need for further experimental
  and theoretical studies into superflow stability.
