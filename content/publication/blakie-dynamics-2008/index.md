abstract: We review phase-space techniques based on the Wigner representation that
  provide an approximate description of dilute ultra-cold Bose gases. In this approach
  the quantum field evolution can be represented using equations of motion of a similar
  form to the Grossâ€“Pitaevskii equation but with stochastic modifications that include
  quantum effects in a controlled degree of approximation. These techniques provide
  a practical quantitative description of both equilibrium and dynamical properties
  of Bose gas systems. We develop versions of the formalism appropriate at zero temperature,
  where quantum fluctuations can be important, and at finite temperature where thermal
  fluctuations dominate. The numerical techniques necessary for implementing the formalism
  are discussed in detail, together with methods for extracting observables of interest.
  Numerous applications to a wide range of phenomena are presented.
