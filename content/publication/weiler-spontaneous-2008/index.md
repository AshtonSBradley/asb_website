abstract: 'Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from protein folding
  and denaturisation, to the superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition, to
  the decoupling of forces in the early universe. Remarkably, phase transitions can
  be arranged into universality classes, where systems having unrelated microscopic
  physics exhibit identical scaling behaviour near the critical point. Here we present
  an experimental and theoretical study of the Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition
  of an atomic gas, focusing on one prominent universal element of phase transition
  dynamics: the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through
  the transition. While the microscopic dynamics of defect formation in phase transitions
  are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluid phase transitions,
  Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities
  for probing such details. Although spontaneously formed vortices in the condensation
  transition have been previously predicted to occur, our results encompass the first
  experimental observations and statistical characterisation of spontaneous vortex
  formation in the condensation transition. Using microscopic theories that incorporate
  atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature
  Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative
  agreement with our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding
  of the development of coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation
  of universal phase-transition dynamics. Published in: Nature 455, 948 (2008).'
