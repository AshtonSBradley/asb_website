abstract: Fluids subjected to suitable forcing will exhibit turbulence, with characteristics
  strongly affected by the fluid’s physical properties and dimensionality. In this
  work, we explore two-dimensional (2D) quantum turbulence in an oblate Bose-Einstein
  condensate confined to an annular trapping potential. Experimentally, we find conditions
  for which small-scale stirring of the condensate generates disordered 2D vortex
  distributions that dissipatively evolve toward persistent currents, indicating energy
  transport from small to large length scales. Simulations of the experiment reveal
  spontaneous clustering of same- circulation vortices and an incompressible energy
  spectrum with k 5=3 dependence for low wave numbers k. This work links experimentally
  observed vortex dynamics with signatures of 2D turbulence in a compressible superfluid.
