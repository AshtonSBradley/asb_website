 abstract = {In this work, we analyse and compare the continuous variable tripartite entanglement available from the use of two concurrent or cascaded Ï‡(2) nonlinearities. We examine both idealized travelling-wave models and more experimentally realistic intracavity models, showing that tripartite entangled outputs are readily producible. These may be a useful resource for applications such as quantum cryptography and teleportation.},
