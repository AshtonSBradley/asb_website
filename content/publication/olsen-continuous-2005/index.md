abstract: In this work, we analyse and compare the continuous variable tripartite
  entanglement available from the use of two concurrent or cascaded Ï‡(2) nonlinearities.
  We examine both idealized travelling-wave models and more experimentally realistic
  intracavity models, showing that tripartite entangled outputs are readily producible.
  These may be a useful resource for applications such as quantum cryptography and
  teleportation.
