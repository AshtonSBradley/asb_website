abstract: 'We investigate two-dimensional turbulence in finite-temperature trapped
  Bose-Einstein condensates within damped Gross-Pitaevskii theory. Turbulence is produced
  via circular motion of a Gaussian potential barrier stirring the condensate. We
  systematically explore a range of stirring parameters and identify three regimes,
  characterized by the injection of distinct quantum vortex structures into the condensate:
  (A) periodic vortex dipole injection, (B) irregular injection of a mixture of vortex
  dipoles and co-rotating vortex clusters, and (C) continuous injection of oblique
  solitons that decay into vortex dipoles. Spectral analysis of the kinetic energy
  associated with vortices reveals that regime (B) can intermittently exhibit a Kolmogorov
  k−5/3 power law over almost a decade of length or wave-number (k) scales. The kinetic
  energy spectrum of regime (C) exhibits a clear k−3/2 power law associated with an
  inertial range for weak-wave turbulence and a k−7/2 power law for high wave numbers.
  We thus identify distinct regimes of forcing for generating either two-dimensional
  quantum turbulence or classical weak-wave turbulence that may be realizable experimentally.'
