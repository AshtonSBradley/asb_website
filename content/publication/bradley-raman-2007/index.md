abstract: We propose and analyze a scheme for measuring the quadrature statistics
  of an atom laser beam using extant optical homodyning and Raman atom laser techniques.
  Reversal of the normal Raman atom laser outcoupling scheme is used to map the quantum
  statistics of an incoupled atomic beam to an optical probe beam. A multimode model
  of the spatial propagation dynamics shows that the Raman incoupler gives a clear
  signal of de Broglie wave quadrature squeezing for both pulsed and continuous inputs.
  Finally, we show that experimental realizations of the scheme may be tested with
  existing methods via intensity correlation measurements.
