abstract: Experimental stirring of a toroidally trapped Bose-Einstein condensate at
  high temperature generates a disordered array of quantum vortices that decays via
  thermal dissipation to form a macroscopic persistent current [T. W. Neely et al.,
  Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 235301 (2013)]. We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations
  of the experimental sequence within the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation
  using ab initio determined reservoir parameters. We find that both damping and noise
  are essential for describing the dynamics of the high-temperature Bose field. The
  theory gives a quantitative account of the formation of a persistent current, with
  no fitted parameters.
