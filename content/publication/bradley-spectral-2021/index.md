abstract: We develop a formal and numerical spectral analysis for U(1) symmetry-breaking
  quantum fluids suitable for analyzing turbulent flows, with specific application
  to the Gross-Pitaevskii fluid. Our formulation establishes the connection between
  energy spectral densities, velocity power spectra, and two-point spatial correlation
  functions for compressible quantum fluids. Removing binning approximations, and
  adding flexibility to $k$-space evaluation, the formulation allows for high resolution
  spectral analysis and reconstruction of correlation functions. A single vortex in
  a trapped planar BEC provides an analytically tractable example with spectral features
  of interest in both the infrared and ultraviolet regimes. Vortex distributions spanning
  the dipole gas, plasma, and clustered phases exhibit increased velocity coherence
  length with increasing vortex energy.
