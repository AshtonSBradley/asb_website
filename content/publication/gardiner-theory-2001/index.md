abstract: We show that a correct formulation of the cold collision frequency shift
  for two photon spectroscopy of Bose-condensed and cold non-Bose-condensed hydrogen
  is consistent with experimental data. Our treatment includes transport and inhomogeneity
  into the theory of a non-condensed gas, which causes substantial changes in the
  cold collision frequency shift for the ordinary thermal gas, as a result of the
  very high frequency (3.9 kHz) of the transverse trap mode. For the condensed gas,
  we find substantial corrections arise from the inclusion of quasiparticles, whose
  number is very large because of the very low frequency (10.2 Hz) of the longitudinal
  trap mode. These two effects together account for the apparent absence of a `factor
  of two' between the two possibilities. Our treatment considers only the Doppler-free
  measurements, but could be extended to Doppler-sensitive measurements. For Bose-condensed
  hydrogen, we predict a characteristic `foot' extending into higher detunings than
  can arise from the condensate alone, as a result of a correct treatment of the statistics
  of thermal quasiparticles.
