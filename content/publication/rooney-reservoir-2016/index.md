abstract: We simulate the dissipative evolution of a vortex in a trapped finite-temperature
  dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensate using first-principles open-systems theory.
  Simulations of the complete stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a
  partially condensed Bose gas containing a single quantum vortex show that the transfer
  of condensate energy to the incoherent thermal component without population transfer
  provides an important channel for vortex decay. For the lower temperatures considered,
  this effect is significantly larger that the population transfer process underpinning
  the standard theory of vortex decay, and is the dominant determinant of the vortex
  lifetime. A comparison with the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin kinetic (two-fluid) theory
  further elucidates the role of the particle transfer interaction, and suggests the
  need for experimental testing of reservoir interaction theory. The dominance of
  this particular energetic decay mechanism for this open quantum system should be
  testable with current experimental setups, and its observation would have broad
  implications for the dynamics of atomic matter waves and experimental studies of
  dissipative phenomena.
