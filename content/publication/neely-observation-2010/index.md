abstract: We report experimental observations and numerical simulations of the formation,
  dynamics, and lifetimes of single and multiply charged quantized vortex dipoles
  in highly oblate dilute-gas Bose- Einstein condensates (BECs). We nucleate pairs
  of vortices of opposite charge (vortex dipoles) by forcing superfluid flow around
  a repulsive Gaussian obstacle within the BEC. By controlling the flow velocity we
  determine the critical velocity for the nucleation of a single vortex dipole, with
  excellent agreement between experimental and numerical results. We present measurements
  of vortex dipole dynamics, finding that the vortex cores of opposite charge can
  exist for many seconds and that annihilation is inhibited in our trap geometry.
  For sufficiently rapid flow velocities, clusters of like-charge vortices aggregate
  into long- lived multiply charged dipolar flow structures.
