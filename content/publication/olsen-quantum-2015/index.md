abstract: It is known that a semiclassical analysis is not always adequate for atomtronics
  devices, but that a fully quantum analysis is often necessary to make reliable predictions.
  While small numbers of atoms at a small number of sites are tractable using the
  density matrix, a fully quantum analysis is often not straightforward as the system
  becomes larger. We show that the fully quantum positive-P representation is then
  a viable calculational tool. We postulate an atomtronic phase gate consisting of
  four wells in a Bose-Hubbard configuration, for which the semiclassical dynamics
  are controllable using the phase of the atomic mode in one of the wells. We show
  that the quantum predictions of the positive-P representation for the performance
  of this device have little relation to those found semiclassically, and that the
  performance depends markedly on the actual quantum states of the initially occupied
  modes. We find that initial coherent states lead to closest to classical dynamics,
  but that initial Fock states give results that are quite different. A fully quantum
  analysis also opens the door for deeply quantum atomtronics, in which properties
  such as entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering become valuable technical
  attributes of a device.
