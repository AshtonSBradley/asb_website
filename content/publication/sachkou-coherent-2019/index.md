abstract: Following vortices around When stirred, superfluids react by creating quantized
  vortices. Studying the dynamics of these vortices, especially in the strongly interacting
  regime, is technically challenging. Sachkou et al. developed a technique for the
  nondestructive tracking of vortices in thin films of superfluid helium-4. Their
  system contained a microtoroid optical cavity coated by a thin film of helium-4,
  in which vortices were created by using laser light. When imaging the subsequent
  dynamics of the vortices, the researchers found that coherent dynamics strongly
  dominated over dissipation. Science, this issue p. 1480 Quantized vortices are fundamental
  to the two-dimensional dynamics of superfluids, from quantum turbulence to phase
  transitions. However, surface effects have prevented direct observations of coherent
  two-dimensional vortex dynamics in strongly interacting systems. Here, we overcome
  this challenge by confining a thin film of superfluid helium at microscale on the
  atomically smooth surface of a silicon chip. An on-chip optical microcavity allows
  laser initiation of clusters of quasiâ€“two-dimensional vortices and nondestructive
  observation of their decay in a single shot. Coherent dynamics dominate, with thermal
  vortex diffusion suppressed by five orders of magnitude. This establishes an on-chip
  platform with which to study emergent phenomena in strongly interacting superfluids
  and to develop quantum technologies such as precision inertial sensors. Nondestructive
  tracking of vortices in thin films of superfluid helium-4 finds that coherent dynamics
  dominate over dissipation. Nondestructive tracking of vortices in thin films of
  superfluid helium-4 finds that coherent dynamics dominate over dissipation.
