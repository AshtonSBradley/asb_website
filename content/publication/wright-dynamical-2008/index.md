abstract: We present a quantum-mechanical treatment of the mechanical stirring of
  Bose-Einstein condensates using classical field techniques. In our approach the
  condensate and excited modes are described using a Hamiltonian classical field method
  in which the atom number and (rotating frame) energy are strictly conserved. We
  simulate a T=0 quasi-two-dimensional condensate perturbed by a rotating anisotropic
  trapping potential. Vacuum fluctuations in the initial state provide an irreducible
  mechanism for breaking the initial symmetries of the condensate and seeding the
  subsequent dynamical instability. Highly turbulent motion develops and we quantify
  the emergence of a rotating thermal component that provides the dissipation necessary
  for the nucleation and motional damping of vortices in the condensate. Vortex lattice
  formation is not observed, rather the vortices assemble into a spatially disordered
  vortex liquid state. We discuss methods we have developed to identify the condensate
  in the presence of an irregular distribution of vortices, determine the thermodynamic
  parameters of the thermal component, and extract damping rates from the classical
  field trajectories.
