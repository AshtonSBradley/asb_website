abstract: Taking an open quantum system approach, we derive a collective equation
  of motion for the dynamics of a matter-wave bright soliton moving through a thermal
  cloud of a distinct atomic species. The reservoir interaction involves energy transfer
  without particle transfer between the soliton and thermal cloud, thus damping the
  soliton motion without altering its stability against collapse. We derive a Langevin
  equation for the soliton center-of-mass velocity in the form of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
  process with analytical drift and diffusion coefficients. This collective motion
  is confirmed by simulations of the full stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation
  for the matter-wave field. The system offers a pathway for experimentally observing
  the elusive energy-damping reservoir interaction and a clear realization of collective
  Brownian motion for a mesoscopic superfluid droplet.
