abstract: The spin-orbit and coherent couplings along with rotation can combine together
  to result in scalar potentials which can modify the trapping potential to yield
  a variety of effective potentials experienced by a particle. The bosons in these
  rotating SO- and coherently-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can thus be
  subjected to rotating effective potentials equivalent to a toroidal, a symmetric
  double-well, an asymmetric double-well potentials, etc. With the increase in rotation
  frequency, the magnitude of spin-expectation per particle for even an antiferromagnetic
  SO-coupled BEC tends to unity, which is consistent with our analysis of the eigenfunctions
  and eigenenergies of the non-interacting Hamiltonian. The breakdown in the degeneracy
  of the minimum energy eigenfunctions of the non-interacting Hamiltonian results
  in the similar behavior of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic SO-coupled BECs.
  This is illustrated by the similar static vortex-lattice patterns, associated spin-textures,
  and mass-currents for the two systems at fast rotations.
