abstract: The process of cascaded down-conversion and sum-frequency generation inside
  an optical cavity has been predicted to be a potential source of three-mode continuous-variable
  entanglement. When the cavity is pumped by two fields, the threshold properties
  have been analyzed, showing that these are more complicated than in well-known processes
  such as optical parametric oscillation. When there is only a single pumping field,
  the entanglement properties have been calculated using a linearized fluctuation
  analysis, but without any consid- eration of the threshold properties or critical
  operating points of the system. In this work we extend this analysis to demonstrate
  that the singly pumped system demonstrates a rich range of threshold behavior when
  quantization of the pump field is taken into account and that asymmetric polychromatic
  entanglement is available over a wide range of operational parameters.
