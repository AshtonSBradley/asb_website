 abstract = {We propose and evaluate a method to construct a quantum-correlated twin-atom laser using a pumped and damped Bose-Hubbard in-line trimer which can operate in a stationary regime. With pumping via a source condensate filling the middle well and damping using either an electron beam or optical means at the two end wells, we show that bipartite quantum correlations build up between the ends of the chain and that these can be measured either in situ or in the outcoupled beams. While nothing similar to our system has yet been achieved experimentally, recent advances mean that it should be practically realizable in the near future.},
