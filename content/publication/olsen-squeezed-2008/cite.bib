 abstract = {The development of the Raman atom laser promises to make available new techniques for accessing and manipulating the quantum statistical properties of Bose-Einstein condensates. In this work we show how, combined with the already existing methods for the manipulation of quantum states of light which are central to quantum optics, the Raman input-output coupling mechanisms potentially enable the production of quadrature squeezed and sub-Poissonian atomic beams, and entanglement between atomic and optical fields. We also propose a method of measuring the quantum statistics of the atomic beam by transferring them to an optical field. Finally, by combning these techniques, we propose a method of teleporting the atom laser beam from one trapped condensate to another.},
