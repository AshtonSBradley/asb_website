abstract: The development of the Raman atom laser promises to make available new techniques
  for accessing and manipulating the quantum statistical properties of Bose-Einstein
  condensates. In this work we show how, combined with the already existing methods
  for the manipulation of quantum states of light which are central to quantum optics,
  the Raman input-output coupling mechanisms potentially enable the production of
  quadrature squeezed and sub-Poissonian atomic beams, and entanglement between atomic
  and optical fields. We also propose a method of measuring the quantum statistics
  of the atomic beam by transferring them to an optical field. Finally, by combning
  these techniques, we propose a method of teleporting the atom laser beam from one
  trapped condensate to another.
