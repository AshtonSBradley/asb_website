abstract: We develop three-mode generalizations of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox,
  allowing us to define inequalities which may be used to indicate continuous-variable
  tripartite entanglement. We use these inequalities and an appropriate version of
  the previously developed van Loock-Furusawa inequalities to theoretically compare
  the continuous-variable tripartite entanglement available from the use of three
  concurrent x(2) nonlinearities and from three independent squeezed states mixed
  on beamsplitters.
