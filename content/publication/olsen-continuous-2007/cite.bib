 abstract = {We develop three-mode generalizations of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, allowing us to define inequalities which may be used to indicate continuous-variable tripartite entanglement. We use these inequalities and an appropriate version of the previously developed van Loock-Furusawa inequalities to theoretically compare the continuous-variable tripartite entanglement available from the use of three concurrent x(2) nonlinearities and from three independent squeezed states mixed on beamsplitters.},
