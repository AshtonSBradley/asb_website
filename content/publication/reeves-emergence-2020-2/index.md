abstract: We experimentally study the emergence of high-energy equilibrium states
  in a chiral vortex gas of like-circulation vortices realized within a disk-shaped
  atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. In contrast to the familiar triangular Abrikosov
  lattice, the lowest-energy state of the superfluid in a rotating frame, we observe
  the formation of rotating vortex equilibria that are highly disordered and have
  significant energy per vortex. Experimental stirring protocols realize equilibrium
  states at both positive and negative absolute temperatures of the vortex gas. At
  sufficiently high energies the system exhibits a symmetry breaking transition, resulting
  in an off-axis equilibrium phase that no longer shares the symmetry of the container.
  By initializing vortices in a non-equilibrium distribution with sufficient energy,
  relaxation to equilibrium is observed within experimental timescales and an off-axis
  equilibrium state emerges at negative absolute temperature. The observed equilibria
  are in close agreement with mean field theory of the microcanonical ensemble of
  the vortex gas.
