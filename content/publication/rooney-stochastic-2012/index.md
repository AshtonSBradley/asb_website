abstract: We have achieved a full implementation of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii
  equation for a three- dimensional trapped Bose gas at finite temperature. Our work
  advances previous applications of this theory, which have only included growth processes,
  by implementing number-conserving scattering processes. We evaluate an analytic
  expression for the coefficient of the scattering term and compare it to that of
  the growth term in the experimental regime, showing that the two coefficients are
  comparable in size. We give an overview of the numerical implementation of the deterministic
  and stochastic terms for the scattering process, and use simulations of a condensate
  excited into a large amplitude breathing mode oscillation to characterize the importance
  of scattering and growth processes in an experimentally accessible regime. We find
  that in such nonequilibrium regimes the scattering can dominate over the growth,
  leading to qualitatively different system dynamics. In particular, the scattering
  causes the system to rapidly reach thermal equilibrium without greatly depleting
  the condensate, suggesting that it provides a highly coherent energy-transfer mechanism.
