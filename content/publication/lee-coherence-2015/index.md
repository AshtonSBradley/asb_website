abstract: A continuous-wave atom laser formed by the outcoupling of atoms from a trapped
  Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) potentially has a range of metrological applications.
  However, in order for the device to be truly continuous, a mechanism to replenish
  the atoms in the BEC is required. Here we calculate the temporal coherence properties
  of a continuously pumped atom laser beam outcoupled from a trapped Bose-Einstein
  condensate that is replenished from a reservoir at finite temperature. We find that
  the thermal fluctuations of the condensate can significantly decrease the temporal
  coherence of the output beam due to atomic interactions between the trapped BEC
  and the beam, and this can impact the metrological usefulness of the device. We
  demonstrate that a Raman outcoupling scheme imparting a sufficient momentum kick
  to the atom laser beam can lead to a significantly reduced linewidth.
