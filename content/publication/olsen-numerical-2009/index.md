abstract: Numerical stochastic integration is a powerful tool for the investigation
  of quantum dynamics in inter- acting many-body systems. As with all numerical integration
  of differential equations, the initial condi- tions of the system being investigated
  must be specified. With application to quantum optics in mind, we show how various
  commonly considered quantum states can be numerically simulated by the use of widely
  available Gaussian and uniform random number generators. We note that the same methods
  can also be applied to computational studies of Boseâ€“Einstein condensates, and give
  some examples of how this can be done.
