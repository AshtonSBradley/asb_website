abstract: We present phase-space techniques for the modelling of spontaneous emission
  in two-level bosonic atoms. The positive-P representation is shown to give a full
  and complete description within the limits of our model. The Wigner representation,
  even when truncated at second order, is shown to need a doubling of the phase-space
  to allow for a positive-definite diffusion matrix in the appropriate Fokker–Planck
  equation and still fails to agree with the full quantum results of the positive-P
  representation. We show that quantum statistics and correlations between the ground
  and excited states affect the dynamics of the emission process, so that it is in
  general non-exponential.
