abstract: We develop a formulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the ultra-cold
  Bose gas in coordinates that adaptively scale with the system size during expansion,
  enabling numerical description of large spatial domains at fine resolution over
  long expansion times. The scaling dynamics is formulated for arbitrary confining
  potentials in terms of the stress tensor of the quantum fluid, a treatment that
  generalizes readily to non-contact interactions. The ideal gas, a cigar-shaped condensate in the Thomas-Fermi regime, and a linear superposition of wavepackets are evolved
  as applications of the scaling dynamics. We observe known scaling for a prolate
  BEC in the Thomas-Fermi regime, and identify a regime of linear self-similar expansion.
  Our results have implications for Bose-Einstein condensate experiments and matter-wave
  manipulation protocols at low temperature.
