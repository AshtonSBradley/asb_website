abstract: Describing partially-condensed Bose gases poses a long-standing theoretical
  challenge. We present exact stochastic Ehrenfest relations for the stochastic projected
  Gross-Pitaevskii equation, including both number and energy damping mechanisms,
  and all projector terms that arise from the energy cutoff separating system from
  reservoir. We test the theory by applying it to the center of mass fluctuations
  of a harmonically trapped prolate system, finding close agreement between c-field
  simulations and ana- lytical results. The formalism lays the foundation to analytically
  explore experimentally accessible hot Bose-Einstein condensates.
