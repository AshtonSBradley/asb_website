abstract: We demonstrate an inverse energy cascade in a minimal model of forced 2D
  quantum vortex turbulence. We simulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a moving
  superfluid subject to forcing by a stationary grid of obstacle potentials, and damping
  by a stationary thermal cloud. The forcing injects large amounts of vortex energy
  into the system at the scale of a few healing lengths. A regime of forcing and damping
  is identified where vortex energy is efficiently transported to large length scales
  via an inverse energy cascade associated with the growth of clusters of same-circulation
  vortices, a Kolmogorov scaling law in the kinetic energy spectrum over a substantial
  inertial range, and spectral condensation of kinetic energy at the scale of the
  system size. Our results provide clear evidence that the inverse energy cascade
  phenomenon, previously observed in a diverse range of classical systems, can also
  occur in quantum fluids.
