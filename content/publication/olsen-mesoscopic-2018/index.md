abstract: Conventional wisdom is that quantum effects will tend to disappear as the
  number of quanta in a system increases, and the evolution of a system will become
  closer to that described by mean-field classical equations. In this Letter we combine
  newly developed theoretical and experimental techniques to propose and analyze an
  experiment using a Bose-Hubbard trimer where the opposite is the case. We find that
  differences in the preparation of a centrally evacuated trimer can lead to readily
  observable differences in the subsequent dynamics which increase with system size.
  Importantly, these differences can be detected by the simple measurements of atomic
  number.
