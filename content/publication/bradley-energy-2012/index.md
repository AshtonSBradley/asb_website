abstract: We theoretically explore key concepts of two-dimensional turbulence in a
  homogeneous compressible superfluid described by a dissipative two-dimensional Gross-Pitaeveskii
  equation. Such a fluid supports quantized vortices that have a size characterized
  by the healing length $. We show that, for the divergence- free portion of the superfluid
  velocity field, the kinetic-energy spectrum over wave number k may be decomposed
  into an ultraviolet regime (k ) $ 1) having a universal k 3 scaling arising from
  the vortex core structure, and an infrared regime (k ( $ 1) with a spectrum that
  arises purely from the configuration of the vortices. The Novikov power-law distribution
  of intervortex distances with exponent  1=3 for vortices of the same sign of circulation
  leads to an infrared kinetic-energy spectrum with a Kolmogorov k 5=3 power law,
  which is consistent with the existence of an inertial range. The presence of these
  k 3 and k 5=3 power laws, together with the constraint of continuity at the smallest
  configurational scale k % $ 1, allows us to derive a new analytical expression for
  the Kolmogorov constant that we test against a numerical simulation of a forced
  homogeneous, compressible, two-dimensional superfluid. The numerical simulation
  corroborates our analysis of the spectral features of the kinetic-energy distribution,
  once we introduce the concept of a clustered fraction consisting of the fraction
  of vortices that have the same sign of circulation as their nearest neighboring
  vortices. Our analysis presents a new approach to understanding two-dimensional
  quantum turbulence and interpreting similarities and differences with classical
  two- dimensional turbulence, and suggests new methods to characterize vortex turbulence
  in two-dimensional quantum fluids via vortex position and circulation measurements.
