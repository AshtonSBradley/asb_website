 abstract = {We theoretically explore key concepts of two-dimensional turbulence in a homogeneous compressible superfluid described by a dissipative two-dimensional Gross-Pitaeveskii equation. Such a fluid supports quantized vortices that have a size characterized by the healing length \$. We show that, for the divergence- free portion of the superfluid velocity field, the kinetic-energy spectrum over wave number k may be decomposed into an ultraviolet regime (k ) \$ 1) having a universal k 3 scaling arising from the vortex core structure, and an infrared regime (k ( \$ 1) with a spectrum that arises purely from the configuration of the vortices. The Novikov power-law distribution of intervortex distances with exponent  1=3 for vortices of the same sign of circulation leads to an infrared kinetic-energy spectrum with a Kolmogorov k 5=3 power law, which is consistent with the existence of an inertial range. The presence of these k 3 and k 5=3 power laws, together with the constraint of continuity at the smallest configurational scale k % \$ 1, allows us to derive a new analytical expression for the Kolmogorov constant that we test against a numerical simulation of a forced homogeneous, compressible, two-dimensional superfluid. The numerical simulation corroborates our analysis of the spectral features of the kinetic-energy distribution, once we introduce the concept of a clustered fraction consisting of the fraction of vortices that have the same sign of circulation as their nearest neighboring vortices. Our analysis presents a new approach to understanding two-dimensional quantum turbulence and interpreting similarities and differences with classical two- dimensional turbulence, and suggests new methods to characterize vortex turbulence in two-dimensional quantum fluids via vortex position and circulation measurements.},
