abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of the well-known process of sum frequency
  generation, showing that it is potentially a very useful source of nonclassical
  states of the electromagnetic field, some of which are not possible with the more
  common techniques. We show that it can produce quadrature squeezed light, bright
  bichromatic entangled states, and symmetric and asymmetric demonstrations of the
  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. We also show that the semiclassical equations totally
  fail to describe the mean-field dynamics when the cavity is strongly pumped.
