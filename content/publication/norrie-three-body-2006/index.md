abstract: We apply the truncated Wigner method to the process of three-body recombination
  in ultracold Bose gases. We find that within the validity regime of the Wigner truncation
  for two-body scattering, three-body recombination can be treated using a set of
  coupled stochastic differential equations that include diffusion terms, and can
  be simulated using known numerical methods. As an example we investigate the behavior
  of a simple homogeneous Bose gas, finding a very slight increase of the loss rate
  compared to that obtained by using the standard method.
