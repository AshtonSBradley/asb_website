 abstract = {We apply the truncated Wigner method to the process of three-body recombination in ultracold Bose gases. We find that within the validity regime of the Wigner truncation for two-body scattering, three-body recombination can be treated using a set of coupled stochastic differential equations that include diffusion terms, and can be simulated using known numerical methods. As an example we investigate the behavior of a simple homogeneous Bose gas, finding a very slight increase of the loss rate compared to that obtained by using the standard method.},
