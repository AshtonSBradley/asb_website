abstract: We examine the feasibility of generating continuous-variable multipartite
  entanglement in an intracavity concurrent downconversion scheme that has been proposed
  for the generation of cluster states by Menicucci et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101,
  130501 (2008)]. By calculating optimized versions of the van Loock-Furusawa correlations
  we demonstrate genuine quadripartite entanglement and investigate the degree of
  entanglement present. Above the oscillation threshold the basic cluster state geometry
  under consideration suffers from phase diffusion. We alleviate this problem by incorporating
  a small injected signal into our analysis. Finally, we investigate squeezed joint
  operators. While the squeezed joint operators approach zero in the undepleted regime,
  we find that this is not the case when we consider the full interaction Hamiltonian
  and the presence of a cavity. In fact, we find that the decay of these operators
  is minimal in a cavity, and even depletion alone inhibits cluster state formation.
