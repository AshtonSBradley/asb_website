abstract: The decay of a vortex from a nonrotating high temperature Bose-Einstein
  condensate is modeled using the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE).
  In order to exploit the tunability of temperature in SPGPE theory while maintaining
  the total atom number constant, we develop a simple and accurate Hartree-Fock method
  to estimate the SPGPE parameters for systems close to thermal equilibrium. We then
  calculate the lifetime of a vortex using three classical field theories that describe
  vortex decay in different levels of approximation. The SPGPE theory is shown to
  give the most complete description of the decay process, predicting significantly
  shorter vortex lifetimes than the alternative theories. Using the SPGPE theory to
  simulate vortex decay for a trapped gas of 5 × 105 87Rb atoms, we calculate a vortex
  lifetime t ̄ that decreases linearly with temperature, falling in the range 20s
  $>$ t ̄ $>$ 1.5s corresponding to the temperature range 0.78Tc 􏰑 T 􏰑 0.93Tc . The
  vortex lifetimes calculated provide a lower bound for the lifetime of a persistent
  current with unit winding number in our chosen trap geometry in the limit of vanishing
  vortex pinning potential.
