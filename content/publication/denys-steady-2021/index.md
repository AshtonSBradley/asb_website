abstract: Triplet down conversion, the process of converting one high-energy photon
  into three low-energy photons, may soon be experimentally feasible in the optical
  regime, due to advances in optical resonator technology. We use quantum phase-space
  techniques to analyze the process of degenerate intracavity triplet down conversion
  by solving stochastic differential equations within the truncated positive-P representation.
  We simulate the time evolution of both intracavity fields, and examine the resulting
  steady-states as a function of the pump intensity. Quantum effects are most pronounced
  in the region immediately above the semi-classical pumping threshold, where our
  numerical results differ significantly from semi-classical predictions. We calculate
  steady-state fluctuation spectra and identify regimes of squeezing, bipartite entanglement,
  and non-Gaussianity measurable in the cavity output fields. We also validate the
  truncated positive-P description against Monte Carlo wave function simulations,
  finding good agreement for low mode populations.
