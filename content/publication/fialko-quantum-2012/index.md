abstract: A vortex can tunnel between two pinning potentials in an atomic Bose-Einstein
  condensate on a time scale of the order of 1s under typical experimental conditions.
  This makes it possible to detect the tunneling experimentally. We calculate the
  tunneling rate by phenomenologically treating vortices as charged particles moving
  in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. The obtained results are in close agreement
  with numerical simulations based on the stochastic c-field theory.
