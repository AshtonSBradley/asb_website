abstract: The emergence of coherent rotating structures is a phenomenon characteristic
  of both classical and quantum two-dimensional (2D) turbulence. In this work we show
  theoretically that the coherent vortex structures that emerge in decaying 2D quantum
  turbulence can approach quasiclassical rigid-body rotation, obeying the Feynman
  rule of constant average areal vortex density while remaining spatially disordered.
  By developing a rigorous link between the velocity probability distribution and
  the quantum kinetic energy spectrum over wave number k, we show that the coherent
  vortex structures are associated with a k3 power law in the infrared region of the
  spectrum, and a well-defined spectral peak that is a physical manifestation of the
  largest structures. We discuss the possibility of realizing coherent structures
  in Bose-Einstein condensate experiments and present Gross-Pitaevskii simulations
  showing that this phenomenon, and its associated spectral signatures, can emerge
  dynamically from feasible initial vortex configurations.
