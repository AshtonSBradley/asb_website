 abstract = {We compute an approximate set of longitudinal quasiparticle modes for a hydrogen condensate as produced in the MIT experiments. An expansion in quasiparticles using a simple one-dimensional Bogoliubov picture shows however that at the high temperatures (≈44 µK) and in the very shallow trap employed (ωz = 2π×10.2 Hz) the contribution to the density from the quasiparticles is about 20% of that from the condensate mode, leading to an effective g2(x,x) which varies between 1 and 3 depending on the position in the condensate.},
