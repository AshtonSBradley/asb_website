abstract: We compute an approximate set of longitudinal quasiparticle modes for a
  hydrogen condensate as produced in the MIT experiments. An expansion in quasiparticles
  using a simple one-dimensional Bogoliubov picture shows however that at the high
  temperatures (≈44 µK) and in the very shallow trap employed (ωz = 2π×10.2 Hz) the
  contribution to the density from the quasiparticles is about 20% of that from the
  condensate mode, leading to an effective g2(x,x) which varies between 1 and 3 depending
  on the position in the condensate.
