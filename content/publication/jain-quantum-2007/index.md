abstract: We study an experimentally realizable system containing stable black hole–white
  hole acoustic horizons in toroidally trapped Bose-Einstein condensates—the quantum
  de Laval nozzle. We numerically obtain stationary flow configurations and assess
  their stability using Bogoliubov theory, finding both in hydrodynamic and nonhydrodynamic
  regimes there exist dynamically unstable regions associated with the creation of
  positive and negative energy quasiparticle pairs in analogy with the gravitational
  Hawking effect. The dynamical instability takes the form of a two mode squeezing
  interaction between resonant pairs of Bogoliubov modes. We study the evolution of
  dynamically unstable flows using the truncated Wigner method, which confirms the
  two mode squeezed state picture of the analogue Hawking effect for low winding number.
