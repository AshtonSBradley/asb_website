abstract: As a test of the Kibble–Zurek mechanism (KZM) of defect formation, we simulate
  the Bose–Einstein condensation transition in a toroidally confined Bose gas by using
  the stochastic projected Gross–Pitaevskii equation, with and without the energy-damping
  reservoir interaction. Energy-damping alters the scaling of the winding-number distribution
  with the quench time—a departure from the universal KZM theory that relies on equilibrium
  critical exponents. Numerical values are obtained for the correlation-length critical
  exponent ν and the dynamical critical exponent z for each variant of reservoir interaction
  theory. The energy-damping reservoir interactions cause significant modification
  of the dynamical critical exponent of the phase transition, while preserving the
  essential KZM critical scaling behavior. Comparison of numerical and analytical
  two-point correlation functions further illustrates the effect of energy damping
  on the correlation length during freeze-out.
